A register proof is a digitally-signed demonstration of the integrity of all
of the entries in a register.  Given a register proof, it is possible to
verify that all of the entries and items are correct, and that the entries are
in the correct order.

TODO: Is this still wanted? It causes indefinition in the specification and
users of multiple registers from different sources would need to explore the
register before being able to use it.

There may be different kinds of register proof available. The exact structure
of the proof will depend on the proof algorithm in use.  The algorithm is
identified by a proof-identifier.

TODO: Proofs should be signed or at least it should be recommended.
