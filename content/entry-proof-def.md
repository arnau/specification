An **entry proof** is the information required to prove the integrity of a single
entry within a register of size total-entries, given a [Register
proof](/glossary/register-proof).

The important characteristic of an entry proof is that it means the client
does not need to download the entire register just to verify the integrity of
a single entry.

There may be different kinds of entry proof available.
