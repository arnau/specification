A catalogue is a curated list of known registers that work well together. The
catalogue MAY be a register itself to provide the same guarantees as the
registers listed in it.

The catalogue MUST provide a way to resolve a [CURIE
expansion](/datatypes/curie#expansion-to-url) by keeping record of prefixes
and base URL mappings.

**NOTE:**

The UK Government catalogue of registers is the [Register
register](https://register.register.gov.uk). It is an old version of the
concept of “catalogue” and lacks the mechanism for proper CURIE expansion.
