A **key** is the identifier for an element in the dataset and thus, it MUST be
unique within a register. Each [entry](/glossary/entry#key) defines what is
the element affected through their key. Also, a [record](/glossary/record/) is
identified by the key within the [snapshot](/glossary/snapshot/).

A key MUST be of type [Key](/datatypes/key/).
